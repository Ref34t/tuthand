      Let me think through this step by step:
      
      1. First, I need to understand: {problem_analysis}
      2. Based on the available information: {information_assessment}
      3. Considering your specific context: {context_application}
      4. Therefore: {conclusion}
      
      Would you like me to proceed with this approach?

  # ReAct - Reasoning and Acting pattern
  react:

    description: "Alternating between reasoning and information gathering"
    use_cases: ["research_queries", "multi_source_answers", "investigation"]

    confidence_threshold: 80
    trust_level: "confirm"
    template: |
      [CONFIDENCE: {confidence}%] [TRUST_LEVEL: confirm]
      
      **Thought**: {initial_reasoning}
      
      **Action**: {information_gathering_step}
      
      **Observation**: {findings}
      
      **Thought**: {updated_reasoning}
      
      **Answer**: {final_response}
      
      Does this address your question, or would you like me to explore any aspect further?

  # Reflection - Self-checking and validation
  reflection:

    use_cases: ["high_stakes_questions", "sensitive_topics", "verification_needed"]
    token_budget: 250-400
    confidence_threshold: 85
    trust_level: "confirm"
    template: |
      [CONFIDENCE: {confidence}%] [TRUST_LEVEL: confirm]
      
      **Initial Response**: {first_answer}
      
      **Reflection**: Let me double-check this answer:
      - Is this information accurate? {accuracy_check}
      - Are there any missing considerations? {completeness_check}
      - Could this be interpreted differently? {interpretation_check}
      
      **Refined Answer**: {improved_response}
      
      I believe this is accurate, but would you like me to verify any specific details?

# Token Optimization Strategies
optimization:
  
  # Context compression techniques
  context_compression:
    techniques:
      - semantic_summarization: "Preserve meaning while reducing tokens"
      - key_extraction: "Focus on essential information only"
      - reference_compression: "Use IDs instead of full content"
      - temporal_pruning: "Remove outdated context"
    
    rules:
      - max_context_tokens: 2000
      - summary_ratio: 0.3  # Compress to 30% of original
      - key_info_preservation: ["user_intent", "critical_facts", "source_references"]
  
  # Prompt caching strategies
  caching:
    cache_types:
      - response_cache: "Store complete responses for identical queries"
      - context_cache: "Cache processed context for similar questions"
      - template_cache: "Pre-compiled prompt templates"
    
    cache_keys:
      - query_hash: "MD5 of normalized query"
      - context_id: "Unique identifier for context state"

    invalidation_triggers:
      - content_update: "Source material changes"
      - time_expiry: "24 hours for dynamic content"
      - user_feedback: "Negative feedback on cached response"
